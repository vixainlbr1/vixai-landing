  <h1>Asset History</h1>

  <p>
    Asset history is the complete technical record of a physical asset over time.
    It includes inspections, measurements, images, failures, maintenance actions
    and — most importantly — the decisions taken based on that information.
  </p>

  <h2>Why asset history matters</h2>

  <p>
    Most organizations store asset-related data, but few preserve asset history
    in a way that supports long-term technical decision-making.
  </p>

  <p>
    When inspection results, photos and reports are treated as isolated files,
    the reasoning behind past decisions is lost. Engineers are forced to reanalyze
    the same problems, often without knowing what was tried before or why.
  </p>

  <h2>Asset history vs maintenance records</h2>

  <p>
    Maintenance records typically answer <em>what</em> was done.
    Asset history answers <em>why</em> it was done.
  </p>

  <p>
    Understanding why a repair was chosen, why a defect was accepted or why a
    component was replaced is critical for managing risk and preventing recurrence.
  </p>

  <h2>The role of evidence</h2>

  <p>
    Photos, measurements and inspection results are not documentation by themselves.
    They become evidence only when they are linked to a decision and placed
    in historical context.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without structure, visual and numerical data quickly lose their value.
  </p>

  <h2>Asset history as technical memory</h2>

  <p>
    Over time, asset history becomes the technical memory of an organization.
    It preserves engineering knowledge beyond individual projects and personnel changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Organizations that treat asset history as a strategic resource are better equipped
    to manage degradation, compliance and long-term risk.
