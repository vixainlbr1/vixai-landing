  <h1>Inspection History</h1>

  <p>
    Inspections are performed to reduce uncertainty.
    However, when inspection results are treated as isolated reports,
    their long-term value is lost.
  </p>

  <h2>What inspection history really means</h2>

  <p>
    Inspection history is the structured record of observations, images,
    measurements and findings collected over time — linked to the decisions
    taken as a result of those inspections.
  </p>

  <p>
    A single inspection answers the question: <em>What is the condition now?</em><br />
    Inspection history answers: <em>How did we get here, and why?</em>
  </p>

  <h2>The problem with inspection reports</h2>

  <p>
    Most inspection data is stored as static reports.
    Once filed, the reasoning behind the conclusions quickly fades.
  </p>

  <p>
    When similar issues appear years later, engineers must re-evaluate the
    same conditions without access to past context, assumptions or outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2>Images without history are not evidence</h2>

  <p>
    Inspection photos are often stored without structure or comparison.
    Without historical reference, images cannot reliably support engineering
    decisions or risk assessments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inspection history transforms images from documentation into evidence.
  </p>

  <h2>Inspection history as a decision tool</h2>

  <p>
    When inspection data is preserved as history, organizations can:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Compare current findings with past conditions</li>
    <li>Understand why previous decisions were taken</li>
    <li>Identify recurring patterns and degradation trends</li>
    <li>Reduce repeated analysis and uncertainty</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Inspection history supports engineering judgment instead of replacing it.
