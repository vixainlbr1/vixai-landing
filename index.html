<h1>Technical Asset Memory, Powered by AI</h1>

<p>
Vixai helps engineering-driven companies preserve, structure and reuse
their technical asset history — inspections, images, measurements and decisions —
so future decisions are based on facts, not memory.

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>
Most companies do not lack technical data. They lack technical memory.
</p>

<p>
Inspection photos are scattered. Measurements live in spreadsheets.
Reports are stored as PDFs. Decisions exist only in emails or in people’s heads.
When experienced engineers leave, the knowledge leaves with them.
</p>

<p>
As a result, the same technical problems are analyzed repeatedly,
past decisions are forgotten, and risk slowly accumulates.
</p>

<h2>Why traditional asset management fails</h2>

<ul>
  <li>CMMS systems track tasks, not reasoning</li>
  <li>Document repositories store files, not context</li>
  <li>Spreadsheets cannot represent technical history</li>
  <li>Photos without structure are not evidence</li>
</ul>

<p>
Technical history is not a folder. It is a timeline of decisions.
</p>

<h2>The Vixai concept</h2>

<p>
Vixai is built around one core idea:
</p>

<p><strong>Every physical asset has a technical history.</strong></p>

<p>
That history includes inspections, images, measurements, failures,
maintenance actions and — most importantly — the decisions taken and why they were taken.
</p>

<p>
Vixai structures this history into a living technical memory that can be queried,
compared and reused.
</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Assets are uniquely identified and tracked over time</li>
  <li>Every inspection, measurement or image becomes a technical event</li>
  <li>Events are linked to evidence and decisions</li>
  <li>History becomes searchable and comparable</li>
  <li>AI assists by summarizing, finding similar cases and highlighting patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>
AI does not replace engineers. It supports engineering judgment.
</p>
<h2>Who Vixai is for</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Industrial and manufacturing companies</li>
  <li>Facilities and utilities operators</li>
  <li>Engineering consultancies</li>
  <li>Inspection and integrity management teams</li>
</ul>

<p>
If your decisions depend on asset condition, history and risk,
Vixai is designed for you.
</p>
<h2>Why companies stay</h2>

<p>
Over time, Vixai becomes the technical memory of your organization.
</p>

<p>
Past inspections, decisions and outcomes remain accessible.
Recurring issues are recognized.
Knowledge survives personnel changes.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the system means losing context — not just data.
</p>
<h2 id="early-access">Early access</h2>

<p>
Vixai is currently in early development.
We are working with a small number of companies to shape the first version.
